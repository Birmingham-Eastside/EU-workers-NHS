In October 2017, we reported on <a href="http://birminghameastside.com/2017/10/17/eu-workers-in-the-nhs-birmingham-hospitals-leavers-are-on-the-rise/" target="_blank">an increase in the proportion of EU workers leaving Birmingham NHS in five out of six hospitals in Birmingham during the last year.</a>

The figures were collected and shared to other media by the BBC Data Unit, after publishing the nationwide investigation <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41556997" target="_blank">"Share of European Union staff leaving NHS rises following Brexit".</a>
